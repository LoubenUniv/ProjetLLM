        <example>
We want to show
-p & -q => -(p + q)

Let's assume
(1) p & -q  is true

In order to derive a contradiction,
let's assume
(2) p + q


With (2) we now distinguish the case
(2 a) p
With (1), we also have -p and thus a contradiction

(2 b) q
With (1), we also have -q and thus a contradiction

 From (2), we therefore derive a contradiction.
